<p>Nowadays supermarkets stock ingredients from across the world and city 
streets are lined with restaurants representing every imaginable country. In the 
West, Indian cooking is among the most popular of eastern cuisines, especially 
now that keen home cooks have discovered how easy it is to prepare authentic, 
tasty and nutritious Indian dishes. Perhaps the secrets of its popularity are 
its subtlety and extraordinary variety.<br />
Given that the subcontinent is so huge with an equally extensive history, it is 
hardly surprising the both its peoples and their diets are so diverse. Religious 
practices have had a profound influence-Hindus don't eat beef, Muslims don't eat 
pork, and Buddhists, among others, are vegetarian. Explorers, conquerors and 
colonizers have had an effect, too, clearly seen in the non- tasting dishes created 
for Moghul emperor or the use of vinegar in the curries of former Portuguese 
territories, for example. Foreign ingredients are most often seen in the dishes 
of western India. Climate and topography play their part and each region of the 
country has a unique style of cooking based on local ingredients. In the north, 
dairy products, such as yogurt and ghee (clarified butter), are featured, as 
well as nuts, while southern cooking is characterized by its use of coconuts, 
their oil, and a variety of chiles.</p>
<p>
Eastern regions are famous for their fish dishes and mustard oil. Delhi is well 
known for tandoori cooking, Kashmir for its meat, especially lamb, Madras for 
its wealth of vegetarian dishes, and Bengal for fine fish and <img alt="delicious dish" height="177" src="images/download%20(2).jpg" width="284" align="right">tooth-achingly 
sweet desserts.<br>However, the cuisines of all regions are united in the use of 
careful blends of spices, which are usually bought whole and ground as needed. 
These mixtures are subtle and aromatic but not invariably hot, although both 
fresh and dried chiles do feature in many dishes. With such a wide variety of 
choice, why not let Indian cuisine add a touch of spice to your culinary 
repertoire?</p>
