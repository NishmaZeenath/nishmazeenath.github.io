<li>1 tbsp ground rice.</li>
<li>1/2 tbsp ground almonds.</li>
<li>8 fl oz/225 ml/1 cup canned evaporated milk.</li>
<li>1/2 tsp saffron threads, toasted in a dry skillet over a high heat.</li>
<li>8 fl oz/225 ml/1 cup heavy cream.</li>
<li>2 tbsp superfine sugar.</li>
<li>2 tbsp chopped toasted blanched almonds, to serve.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<h3>method</h3>
<p>1. Put the milk in the skillet over medium-high heat, add the saffron threads, 
and heat just until small bubbles appear around the edge. Remove the pan from 
the heat and let the saffron steep for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 
the ground rice and ground almonds in a heatproof bowl. Put a flat freezerproof 
container into the freezer.<br />
2. Reheat the milk and saffron just until small bubbles appear, then slowly beat 
the milk into the almond <img alt="" src="images/images%20(1).jpg" align="right"/>mixture, until smooth. Pour the evaporated milk into a 
pan and bring to a boil, stirring. Remove the pan and stir into the
milk 
mixture. Stir in the cream and sugar.<br />
3. Return the pan to medium heat and simmer, stirring constantly, for 5-10 minutes, until it thickens, but do not boil. Remove the pan 
from the heat and set aside, stirring frequently, to cool. Pour the saffron 
mixture into the freezerproof bowl and freeze for 30 minutes, then beat to break 
up any ice crystals. Beat every 30 minutes, until the ice cream is thick and 
almost firm.<br />
4. Divide the mixture among 4 kulfi molds or ramekins. Cover and freeze until 
solid. To serve, dip a dish towel in hot water, wring it out, and rub it around 
the sides of the molds or ramekins, then invert onto plates. Sprinkle with 
toasted almonds and serve.</p>
