<h1>chile-cilantro naan</h1>
<h3>ingredients (makes 8)</h3>
<img alt="" src="images/download%20(6).jpg"  align="right"/>
<ul>
<li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 tsp sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>generous 1 cup milk</li>
<li>2 tbsp sunflower oil or olive oil, plus extra for oiling</li>
<li>2 fresh red chiles, chopped
<li>1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
<li>2 tbsp butter, melted</li>
</ul> 
&nbsp;<h3>method</h3>
<p>1. Sift the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder together into a large bowl. 
Whisk the egg and milk together, then add to the flour and mix until a dough is 
formed.<br />
2. Transfer the dough to a counter, make a depression in the center of the dough, 
and add the oil. Knead for 3-4 minutes, until you have a smooth and pliable 
dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour. Divide the dough 
into 8 <img alt="" src="images/download%20(7).jpg" align="left" />equal-size pieces; form each piece into a ball, and flatten into a thick 
cake. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10-15 minutes.<br />
3. Preheat the broiler to high. Line a broiler pan with foil and brush with oil. 
Roll each flattened cake into a 5-inch/13-cm circle and pull the lower end 
gently. Carefully roll out again, maintaining the teardrop shape, to about 9 
inches/23 cm in diameter.<br />
4. Mix the chiles and cilantro together, then spread 
on the surface of the naans. 
Press gently so the mixture sticks to the dough. Transfer a naan to the prepared 
broiler pan and cook for 1 minute, or until slight puffed and brown patches 
appear on the surface. Turn over and cook the other side for 45-50 seconds, until 
lightly browned. Remove from the broiler and brush with the melted butter. Wrap 
in a dish towe while you cook the remaining naans.</p>
